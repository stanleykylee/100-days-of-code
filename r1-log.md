## Log

### R1D1 
Easing myself into the challenge, started by picking up where I left off previously, with the 30 days of code challenge from HackerRank. I will complete this this time around! :)

### R1D2
Didn't get through as much as I would have wanted but I completed the Day 11: 2D Arrays of the 30 Days of Code Challenge from HackerRank.
