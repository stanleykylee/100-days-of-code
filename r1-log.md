The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on December 28, 2017.

## Log

### R1D1 
Easing myself into the challenge, started by picking up where I left off previously, with the 30 days of code challenge from HackerRank. I will complete this this time around! :)

### R1D2
Didn't get through as much as I would have wanted but I completed the Day 11: 2D Arrays of the 30 Days of Code Challenge from HackerRank.

### R1D3
Got through Day 12: Inheritance today. Got stuck a bit on the constructor, didn't understand fully about the use of super and read a bit more about it. Was a good learning experience and will most likely follow up on the discussions of the day.

### R1D4
#100DaysOfCode #R1D4 Happy New Year's everyone! Super day today, I completed 3 of the 30 days of code from @hackerrank. Planning to plow through the rest and head onto my next goals - Learning R! Check out my updated log!
