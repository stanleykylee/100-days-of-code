# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Stanley Lee

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on December 28, 2017.

## Log

### R1D1 
Easing myself into the challenge, started by picking up where I left off previously, with the 30 days of code challenge from HackerRank. I will complete this this time around! :)

### R1D2
Didn't get through as much as I would have wanted but I completed the Day 11: 2D Arrays of the 30 Days of Code Challenge from HackerRank.

### R1D3
Got through Day 12: Inheritance today. Got stuck a bit on the constructor, didn't understand fully about the use of super and read a bit more about it. Was a good learning experience and will most likely follow up on the discussions of the day.

### R1D4
#100DaysOfCode #R1D4 Happy New Year's everyone! Super day today, I completed 3 of the 30 days of code from @hackerrank. Planning to plow through the rest and head onto my next goals - Learning R! Check out my updated log!

### R1D5
#100DaysOfCode #R1D5 New Year's Day! What a start to 2018. Completed another 2 days of the 30 days of code challenge, I'm past the halfway mark now and only 13 challenges to go! I also took the time to visit Codewars and completed one kata. Can't wait to do more.

### R1D6
#100DaysOfCode #R1D6 Taking a break today from 30 days of code challenges and registered for Johns Hopkins' R Programming course. Spent time setting up my environment and watching videos. I'm auditing it for now, but maybe I'll upgrade later?

### R1D7
#100DaysOfCode #R1D7 A bit late to update but was working on a buddy's system as I didn't have access to my own system. However, did complete one challenge and learned about ArrayDeque for Java! Cool stuff!

### R1D8
#100DaysOfCode #R1D8 Learning day today, started using Enki app, MOOC course on R and CS50 started and last but not least, started a side project to create Shopify Apps!

### R1D9
#100DaysOfCode #R1D9 KILLED IT!!! Six days down of the 30 days of code challenge from @hackerrank. I'm now on day 25, which means I can possibly complete this tomorrow! Go go go!

### R1D10
#100DaysOfCode #R1D10 Another day of code done, that's 10 days now! I got a bit stuck with the primality test today and didn't get to go through as much as I would have liked. However, I was able to finally wrap my head around algorithm efficiencies and complexities.

### R1D11
#100DaysOfCode #R1D11 Success! 30 Days of Code from @hackerrank completed now. For those on the same quest, don't give up, and push through! In the last 11 days, I had thoughts of taking a rest due to one reason or another. But taking a slow day is OK, just keep going!
