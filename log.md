# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 28, 2017

#### Today's Progress
First day, completed one 30 days of code challenge from HackerRank.

#### Thoughts
Struggled a bit with getting back into the groove of things. For example, forgot to use the Scanner to get input instead of just using System.in.read().

### Day 2: December 29, 2017

#### Today's Progress
Completed another day of 30 days of code challenge from HackerRank. Started looking at the FreeCodeCamp's Back End Development Certification. Completed Automated Testing and Debugging portion.

#### Thoughts
While I was able to complete the challenge using my own methods, reading the discussions I noticed that there are better ways to complete the challenge. For this instance, I should store the values in an Array and then sort it to find the max value instead of iterating through comparisons. Using the array would be more efficient and accurate.
