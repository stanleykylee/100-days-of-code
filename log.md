# 100 Days Of Code Log

Welcome, this is my 100 Days of Code Round 1 Log. I have decided to do this challenge to get myself into a habit of coding. My current plan is to:

* Complete the [30 Days of Code Challenge](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/30-days-of-code) from HackerRank
* Complete the [Back End Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/map-aside#Back-End-Development-Certification) from FreeCodeCamp
* Learn Java
* Learn R

# Day 1: Thursday, December 28, 2017

## #30daysofcode

### Today's Progress
First day, completed one 30 days of code challenge from HackerRank.

### Thoughts
Struggled a bit with getting back into the groove of things. For example, forgot to use the Scanner to get input instead of just using System.in.read().

# Day 2: Friday, December 29, 2017

## #30daysofcode

### Today's Progress
Completed another day of 30 days of code challenge from HackerRank. Started looking at the FreeCodeCamp's Back End Development Certification. Completed Automated Testing and Debugging portion.

### Thoughts
While I was able to complete the challenge using my own methods, reading the discussions I noticed that there are better ways to complete the challenge. For this instance, I should store the values in an Array and then sort it to find the max value instead of iterating through comparisons. Using the array would be more efficient and accurate.

# Day 3: Saturday, December 30, 2017 

## #30daysofcode, #pipeline

### Today's Progress
Completed one more day of the 30 days of code challenge from HackerRank. I also did some coding with Declarative Pipelines for Jenkins but I don't have anything that I can post here.

### Thoughts
Today was on the lighter side of things as I spent more time on the Jenkins declarative pipeline code. I did learn something new about inheritance and the use of the super() class during the construction of inherited classes. I believe even small steps like this is good for learning more about Object Orientated Programming.

# Day 4: Sunday, December 31, 2017

## #30daysofcode

### Today's Progress
Completed three days of the 30 days of code challenge today! It's New Year's Eve but I thought why not? Let's push through this and get to the next goals.

### Thoughts
In doing some of these challenges from HackerRank I found that one of the more difficult things was trying to debug the code. Without a proper development environment, I had to relay on quite a bit of System.out.println() to see what was happening. Something else that I am noticing is that the time spent reading the editorials after I complete a challenge has been helpful. Seeing other people's insights into the problem and challenge gave me new insights. I will continue to spend time reading through the editorials as I complete the challenges.

# Day 5: Monday, January 1, 2018

## #30daysofcode #8kyu

### Today's Progress
Completed two more days of the 30 days of code challenge. I took a small break to try out codewars and completed one 8 kyu python kata.

### Thoughts
I really liked the Codewars kata and the whole concept of katas and using the kyu/dan system. I may be a bit biased as I've always had an interest in Go but never got really good at it. This could be my way to go up the ranks while practicing coding. I also liked being able to see other people's solutions on the platform. I'm looking forward to discussing with others about these solutions and to learn from these experiences.

# Day 6: Tuesday, January 2, 2018

## #r #pipeline #docker

### Today's Progress
Registered for and started the Johns Hopkins R Programming Coursera course.

### Thoughts
I need to prepare for my upcoming course which will use R programming. So hopefully I am able to fast track this 4 week program and get a head start for my future coursework. It felt like a bit of a cheat day in terms of coding, but I was able to spend some time working on a side project. That project mostly contained working with Jenkins pipeline code and running a Flask Application in Docker. So there was some learning done there. Tomorrow I will catch up with the 30 days of code and aim for at least one more kata!

# Day 7: Wednesday, January 3, 2018

## #30daysofcode

### Today's Progress
Just one day of challenges completed today.

### Thoughts
I didn't have access to my regular system today and had to work on another person's laptop. Even though checking out the repositories and working on the code can be done, I found that without the environment that I am used to, it just didn't feel the same. Other than that, I did complete one challenge from the 30 days of code challenge. Today I worked on stacks and queues. While I'm sure the challenge would have asked me to use Stack and LinkedList, I ended up learning about ArrayDeque. Apparently this is much quicker and does both all in one!
