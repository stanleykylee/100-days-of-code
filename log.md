# 100 Days Of Code Log

Welcome, this is my 100 Days of Code Round 1 Log. I have decided to do this challenge to get myself into a habit of coding. My current plan is to:

* Complete the [30 Days of Code Challenge](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/30-days-of-code) from HackerRank
* Complete the [Back End Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/map-aside#Back-End-Development-Certification) from FreeCodeCamp
* Learn Java
* Learn R

# Day 1: Thursday, December 28, 2017

## #30daysofcode

### Today's Progress
First day, completed one 30 days of code challenge from HackerRank.

### Thoughts
Struggled a bit with getting back into the groove of things. For example, forgot to use the Scanner to get input instead of just using System.in.read().

# Day 2: Friday, December 29, 2017

## #30daysofcode

### Today's Progress
Completed another day of 30 days of code challenge from HackerRank. Started looking at the FreeCodeCamp's Back End Development Certification. Completed Automated Testing and Debugging portion.

### Thoughts
While I was able to complete the challenge using my own methods, reading the discussions I noticed that there are better ways to complete the challenge. For this instance, I should store the values in an Array and then sort it to find the max value instead of iterating through comparisons. Using the array would be more efficient and accurate.

# Day 3: Saturday, December 30, 2017 

## #30daysofcode, #pipeline

### Today's Progress
Completed one more day of the 30 days of code challenge from HackerRank. I also did some coding with Declarative Pipelines for Jenkins but I don't have anything that I can post here.

### Thoughts
Today was on the lighter side of things as I spent more time on the Jenkins declarative pipeline code. I did learn something new about inheritance and the use of the super() class during the construction of inherited classes. I believe even small steps like this is good for learning more about Object Orientated Programming.

## #30daysofcode

### Today's Progress
Completed three days of the 30 days of code challenge today! It's New Year's Eve but I thought why not? Let's push through this and get to the next goals.

### Thoughts
In doing some of these challenges from HackerRank I found that one of the more difficult things was trying to debug the code. Without a proper development environment, I had to relay on quite a bit of System.out.println() to see what was happening. Something else that I am noticing is that the time spent reading the editorials after I complete a challenge has been helpful. Seeing other people's insights into the problem and challenge gave me new insights. I will continue to spend time reading through the editorials as I complete the challenges.

## #30daysofcode #8kyu

### Today's Progress
Completed two more days of the 30 days of code challenge. I took a small break to try out codewars and completed one 8 kyu python kata.

### Thoughts
I really liked the Codewars kata and the whole concept of katas and using the kyu/dan system. I may be a bit biased as I've always had an interest in Go but never got really good at it. This could be my way to go up the ranks while practicing coding. I also liked being able to see other people's solutions on the platform. I'm looking forward to discussing with others about these solutions and to learn from these experiences.

# Day 6: Tuesday, January 2, 2018

## #r #pipeline #docker

### Today's Progress
Registered for and started the Johns Hopkins R Programming Coursera course.

### Thoughts
I need to prepare for my upcoming course which will use R programming. So hopefully I am able to fast track this 4 week program and get a head start for my future coursework. It felt like a bit of a cheat day in terms of coding, but I was able to spend some time working on a side project. That project mostly contained working with Jenkins pipeline code and running a Flask Application in Docker. So there was some learning done there. Tomorrow I will catch up with the 30 days of code and aim for at least one more kata!

# Day 7: Wednesday, January 3, 2018

## #30daysofcode

### Today's Progress
Just one day of challenges completed today.

### Thoughts
I didn't have access to my regular system today and had to work on another person's laptop. Even though checking out the repositories and working on the code can be done, I found that without the environment that I am used to, it just didn't feel the same. Other than that, I did complete one challenge from the 30 days of code challenge. Today I worked on stacks and queues. While I'm sure the challenge would have asked me to use Stack and LinkedList, I ended up learning about ArrayDeque. Apparently this is much quicker and does both all in one!

# Day 8: Thursday, January 4, 2018

## #enki #shopifyapp #mooc

### Today's Progress
Learn by using Enki, started a side project and class started!

### Thoughts
Did something different today and spent time with another App I found, Enki. It provides a good overview of different programming data structures and algorithms. It provides this knowledge through what they call workouts. Short snippets of knowledge delivered through small lessons. I will continue to work on these workouts to strengthen my knowledge.

Aside from that I spent some additional time thinking about a side project I want to start. After some discussions with a few friends, I decided that I want to try creating a shopify app. I took a couple of steps in this direction already and created a developer account on Shopify. I also went through a bit of their tutorial on the APIs. Hopefully this will continue tomorrow and I will start creating a basic app.

Lastly, my MOOC courses started this week. I will be learning about R and CS in general. I hpoe this will not impede on my 100 days of code challenge too much.

# Day 9: Friday, January 5, 2018

## #30daysofcode

### Today's Progress
Worked on 30 days of code and did some MOOC learning

### Thoughts
Push, push, push! Did 6 days worth of the 30 days of code challenge today. A lot of these had to do with linked lists and the challenge I did a couple of days ago help a lot. Also, the readings I was doing on Enki surprisingly helped on one of the challenges, specially on finding multiples, came back to. I'm starting to feel that doing these daily are providing results. While these are still just helping with future challenges, I'm sure there will soon be a time where I will be using these to help with live projects.

# Day 10: Saturday, January 6, 2018

## #30daysofcode

### Today's Progress
Worked on only one challenge

### Thoughts
Today's challenge was a lot hard than I should have made it. But I think I learned quite a bit about how I can make my algorithm more efficient. Failing the time limit and complexity test cases really made me re-think about how to approach this problem. I had originally decided to use what I learnt from Enki, about the Sieve of Eratosthenes and Primality test. After I got my head around the Sieve and implemneted it, for some reason it was less efficient. I think there are only certain cases where the Primality test as described by Enki becomes more efficient by using the Sieve. Additionally, if we have to create the Sieve as part of the Primality test, it adds to the overhead. I believe if the Sieve was created once and reused over by the multiple numbers, the test would have been quicker.

I'll put this in my to do list of side projects to test this theory.
