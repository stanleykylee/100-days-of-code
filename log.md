# 100 Days Of Code Log

Welcome, this is my 100 Days of Code Round 1 Log. I have decided to do this challenge to get myself into a habit of coding. My current plan is to:

* Complete the [30 Days of Code Challenge](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/30-days-of-code) from HackerRank
* Complete the [Back End Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/map-aside#Back-End-Development-Certification) from FreeCodeCamp
* Learn Java
* Learn R

# Day 1: Thursday, December 28, 2017

## #30daysofcode

### Today's Progress
First day, completed one 30 days of code challenge from HackerRank.

### Thoughts
Struggled a bit with getting back into the groove of things. For example, forgot to use the Scanner to get input instead of just using System.in.read().

# Day 2: Friday, December 29, 2017

## #30daysofcode

### Today's Progress
Completed another day of 30 days of code challenge from HackerRank. Started looking at the FreeCodeCamp's Back End Development Certification. Completed Automated Testing and Debugging portion.

### Thoughts
While I was able to complete the challenge using my own methods, reading the discussions I noticed that there are better ways to complete the challenge. For this instance, I should store the values in an Array and then sort it to find the max value instead of iterating through comparisons. Using the array would be more efficient and accurate.

# Day 3: Saturday, December 30, 2017 

## #30daysofcode, #pipeline

### Today's Progress
Completed one more day of the 30 days of code challenge from HackerRank. I also did some coding with Declarative Pipelines for Jenkins but I don't have anything that I can post here.

### Thoughts
Today was on the lighter side of things as I spent more time on the Jenkins declarative pipeline code. I did learn something new about inheritance and the use of the super() class during the construction of inherited classes. I believe even small steps like this is good for learning more about Object Orientated Programming.

# Day 4: Sunday, December 31, 2017

## #30daysofcode

### Today's Progress
Completed three days of the 30 days of code challenge today! It's New Year's Even but I thought why not? Let's push through this and get to the next goals.

### Thoughts
In doing some of these challenges from HackerRank I found that one of the more difficult things was trying to debug the code. Without a proper development environment, I had to relay on quite a bit of System.out.println() to see what was happening. Something else that I am noticing is that the time spent reading the editorials after I complete a challenge has been helpful. Seeing other people's insights into the problem and challenge gave me new insights. I will continue to spend time reading through the editorials as I complete the challenges.
